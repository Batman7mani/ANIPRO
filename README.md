# ANIPRO - Anime Streaming Website

ANIPRO is a simple and aesthetic anime streaming website built using **pure HTML and CSS**. It showcases popular anime content in a clean, static layout â€” no frameworks, no JavaScript (yet!). This is my **first-year personal project** as I begin my journey into web development.

## Features

-  Embedded anime episodes using the `<video>` tag
-  Poster images for video thumbnails
-  Fully responsive and visually styled using CSS
-  Basic audio support and future subtitle integration
-  Clean project structure and semantic HTML5

##  Challenges Faced

- Debugging video playback issues due to incorrect file paths
- Adjusting CSS for different screen sizes
- Uploading large video files (and realizing GitHub isn't ideal for that)

##  What I Learned

- How to structure a project using only HTML and CSS
- Embedding videos with `<video>` and adding subtitles using `<track>`
- Working with responsive layouts and background images
- Hosting code on GitHub and managing repositories
