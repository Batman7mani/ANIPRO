# ANIPRO – Anime Streaming Interface (Frontend Project)

**ANIPRO** is a fully responsive anime streaming website interface built to replicate the structure and design of a real-world OTT platform. It allows users to view episodes, read summaries, and explore anime content in a clean, visually engaging layout.

## Purpose of Development

This project was created to:
- Strengthen my frontend development skills using only HTML and CSS.
- Practice building multi-section page layouts and media-focused UIs.
- Explore UI/UX principles by mimicking real streaming platform behavior.
- Improve responsive design techniques without using frameworks.

## Key Features

- Structured episode panel with individual buttons for navigation.
- Video container with layout adaptability for mobile and desktop screens.
- Static review and comment sections for visual feedback simulation.
- Recommendation area styled to reflect common OTT experiences.
- Responsive design for smooth experience on all screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** – Semantic structure, layout containers, and content.
- **CSS** – Styling, responsiveness, layout alignment, and animations.
- **Netlify** – Hosting the live project with instant deployment.

## What I Learned

- Creating complex grid and flex layouts from scratch.
- Handling element stacking and spacing for different screen resolutions.
- Using pure CSS to simulate interactivity and flow in a multimedia UI.
- Designing responsive UIs without relying on JavaScript or frameworks.
- Debugging mobile layout issues and optimizing view hierarchy.

## Challenges Faced

- Structuring elements so that they adapt across devices consistently.
- Maintaining visual clarity while using only HTML/CSS (without JS logic).
- Avoiding layout collisions and overflow on smaller screens.
- Creating a realistic OTT-like UI without real backend data or logic.
