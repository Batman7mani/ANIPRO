# ANIPRO - Anime Streaming Website

ANIPRO is a simple and aesthetic anime streaming website built using **pure HTML and CSS**. It showcases popular anime content in a clean, static layout â€” no frameworks, no JavaScript (yet!). This is my **first-year personal project** as I begin my journey into web development.
